### Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

#### Prerequistes

1. Create an API KEY for the TMDB API

2. Create a Firebase account (if you don't have one already), and create a new project. On the Firebase Console, set up the project by adding Firestore, Authentication features and copy the firebase Config from the project settings, you'll need it to initialize firebase on your app.

3. Create a config folder and add your API KEY and firebase config then export them to where you want to use them (alternatively, you can create an .env.local in the root of your directory and add them there.)

#### Installing

Clone the repsitory and run the development server:

```
npm install
npm run dev

// or

yarn install
yarn dev
```
